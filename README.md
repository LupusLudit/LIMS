# LIMS - Lightweight Image Manipulation Software

LIMS is a lightweight image-editing application written in C#.
It features a clean and simple user interface built with the WPF framework.
Users can import multiple images simultaneously, making it easy to edit several files in one session.
The core idea behind LIMS is to let users apply the same tool or effect to a batch of images with minimal effort.
Currently, the application supports applying watermarks to imported files, with additional tools and features planned as development continues.
